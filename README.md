# EIGRPWN
**Repository for attacks on EIGRP routing domains**

**EIGRPHelloDoS.py** - a tool for exploitation a DoS attack, flooding with EIGRP Hello messages

**EIGRPexternalinject.py** - a tool for route injection in the EIGRP domain. Pay attention, if you are going to carry out injections for the further purpose of intercepting traffic, use this script, because it works more stable than **eigrpinternalinject.py**. This script performs an injection of external EIGRP routes.

**EIGRPinternalinject.py** - a tool for injecting internal EIGRP routes

**EIGRPtableoverflow.py** - a tool for attacking the EIGRP routing table. Causes an overflow of the . DoS routing table.
